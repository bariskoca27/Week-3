📌 Week 3 Challenge Submission – Pizza Paradise Interactive Website
👨‍🍳 Built by Baris Koca

✅ What I Have Done:

🍕 Developed a multi-page, fully responsive pizza shop website using Bootstrap 4.5 and JavaScript, without any custom CSS styling except minimal inline styles for layout tweaks. The site delivers an engaging user experience with dynamic content, form validation, and smooth page navigation.

🧩 Challenge Requirements Met:

    Multi-page structure: Home, Menu, Order, and Contact pages implemented as toggleable content sections.

    Bootstrap Layout & Styling:

        Used Bootstrap grid and card components for menu items layout.

        Navbar is responsive and uses Bootstrap collapse for mobile toggling.

        Forms styled entirely with Bootstrap form classes.

    Dynamic Menu & Cart:

        Menu items dynamically generated from JavaScript object.

        Add-to-cart buttons update cart contents and total price interactively.

    Form Validation & Interaction:

        JavaScript validation for order form fields (name, phone, delivery address if delivery selected).

        Delivery date uses jQuery UI datepicker to select valid delivery dates only (minDate = today).

    Cart Management:

        Cart saved in localStorage for persistence.

        Reset cart functionality to clear all selections.

    Navigation:

        Clicking nav links or buttons switches between content pages without reload.

    Contact Form:

        Simple contact form with required validation fields for name, email, and message.

    Accessibility & UX:

        Clear user alerts on missing fields or empty cart submissions.

        Delivery address input toggles visibility and required attribute based on delivery method.

🧠 Key JavaScript Functions Explained:

    loadProducts(): Generates menu item cards dynamically based on the products data object.

    attachAddButtons(): Adds event listeners to "Add to Cart" buttons, updating the cart array and saving to localStorage.

    updateMenuTotal(): Calculates and displays the total price of items in the cart.

    loadOrder(): Renders the cart contents into an order summary table on the Order page.

    toggleAddressField(): Shows/hides the delivery address input depending on the delivery option selected, enforcing required input when needed.

    Event handlers for navigation links toggle page visibility without full page reload.

    Form submission handler validates input fields, cart contents, and delivery date before confirming the order.

    jQuery UI datepicker initialized on the delivery date input to ensure valid date selection.

📱 Responsive Design:

    Entire site adapts fluidly to screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid and responsive classes.

    Navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on small devices using Bootstrap's built-in collapse component.

    Images and cards scale appropriately with device width.
